#### "Section header"
# Defines a name/id for sections. Should be alphanumeric.
#
[Section1]

#### Section type 'type'
# A section type must be define
# Section type can be either range or geo
#
#  range: "database file containing ranges"
#      - Use this if you want to define ips that should be either whitelisted
#      or blacklisted based on the IP address alone.
#
#  geo: "database file containing ranges with geolocation"
#      - Use this if you want to define ips that should be either whitelisted
#      or blacklisted based on the country of the IP address.
#
#
type=geo

#### by_*
# Use one, or a combination of by_* to define which interfaces this
# section's rules should be applied to.
#
# dXDP searches interfaces with matching properties.
#
# Commas are optional and acceptable.
#
#
#by_name=eno1
#by_index=3,2
#by_ipv4s_subnet=255.255.255.0,255.255.255.254
#by_mac=02:DE:AD:BE:EF:00
#by_ipv4=10.0.0.2
#by_ipv6=2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::1
#by_ipv6s_prefix=2001

#### mode
# Mode determines what happens if a packet with matching IP address has
# landed on the network interface.
#
# If mode is whitelist, then, only ip addresses in db_ipv4_paths, 
# db_ipv6_paths, or added via --add-ip using the interface will be allowed.
#
# If mode is whitelist, and an ip is added using --remove-ip, then,
# said IP will always be blocked regardless of the data source.
#
# All other IPs will be blocked.
#
# If mode is blacklist, then, ip addresses in db_ipv4_paths,  db_ipv6_paths,
# or added via --add-ip will be blocked.
#
# If mode is blacklist, then, and an ip added using --remove-ip will always be
# allowed regardless of the data source.
#
# All other IPs will be allowed.
#
#
mode=whitelist

#### cc
# cc, or "country code", should only be defined when using type geo.
#
# cc specifies which countries are relevant in our section.
#
# if mode is whitelist, then, only IPs from the countries defined are allowed
#
# if mode is blacklist, then, IPs from the countries below are blocked
#
# Commas are acceptable.
#
#
cc=US,CN

#### db_ipv4_paths db_ipv6_paths
# db_ipv4_paths and db_ipv6_paths define the paths to the database files.
#
# If type is geo, then, at least one IPV4 or IPV6 database path is required. 
# 
# If you are blocking only IPV4 addresses, then comment out db_ipv6_paths.
# If you are blocking only IPv6 addresses, then comment out db_ipv4_paths.
# If you are blocking both, then, don't comment out any.
#
# If type is range, then, no db paths are required. If specified, they
# act as a method to block/allow a static list of ip addresses, where rules
# can be modified using the interfaces
#
# dXDP will never edit these files. dXDP will only read these files. 
# 
# GeoLocation databases are not automatically downloaded for security.
# To download, run dx-update-db as root.
#
# Commas are optional and acceptable.

### Example #1
# I want to block all IP addresses in '~/blacklisted_ips.csv' on interface
# eno1
#
# I understand that I can dynamically add blocked IPs to this section by
# running dxdp --add-ip -s MyBlacklistedIPs -a new_ip, etc.

### Example #2
# I want to only allow IP addresses from the USA on interface 2
#
# I understand that to download the IP geolocation database, I must run
# 'dx-db-update.' I should run this command from time to time to keep the 
# database updated.
#
# I understand that I can override rules for this by using the interface
# --add-ip ()

### Example #3
# I want to only allow IP addresses in '~/whitelisted_ips.csv' on
# any interface with subnet of '255.255.255.0'
#
# I understand that I can dynamically add allowed IPs to this section by
# running dxdp -s MyWhitelistedIps -add-ip new_ip etc.
#
# I understand that if I do dxdp -s MyWhitelistedIps --remove-ip new_ip,
# then new_ip is NOT whitelisted and thus blocked.
